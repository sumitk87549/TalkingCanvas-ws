            Talking Canvas was born from a profound belief that art is more than decoration—it's a conversation,
            a bridge between the artist's soul and the viewer's heart.
          </p>

          <p>
            Founded in 2024, our gallery emerged from a personal journey of resilience and transformation.
            What began as a therapeutic outlet during turbulent times evolved into a mission to share the
            healing power of art with the world. Each painting in our collection carries not just pigment
            and canvas, but stories of hope, struggle, beauty, and triumph.
          </p>

          <p>
            We believe that every brushstroke is a word, every color a sentence, and every painting a complete
            narrative waiting to be discovered. Our name, "Talking Canvas," reflects this philosophy—that art
            speaks when given the space to breathe and the audience to listen.

          <h3>Praveen Kumar</h3>
          <p class="artist-tagline">Engineer by Day, Artist by Heart</p>

          <p>
            Born from a turbulent childhood marked by family conflict, Praveen transforms pain into
            vibrant canvases that speak of resilience and quiet hope. He carries forward his father's
            artistic legacy, creating pieces that feel both intimate and universal.
          </p>

          <p>
            An IIT Roorkee B.Tech and JNU M.Tech graduate who codes by day at Capgemini, Praveen blends
            technical precision with wide-ranging curiosity. His interests in astrology, politics, and
            economics inform his artistic vision, creating works that are intellectually engaging and
            emotionally resonant.
          </p>

          <p>
            Married to Pooja and father to 17-year-old Hita, Praveen's paintings invite collectors to
            connect with stories of survival, wisdom, and understated beauty. Each piece is a testament
            to the human spirit's capacity to create beauty from adversity.
