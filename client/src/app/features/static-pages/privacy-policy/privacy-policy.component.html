    <p class="intro">Hello! Let's Keep This Simple.</p>
    <p class="intro-text">We believe privacy policies should be easy to understand, not filled with legal jargon. Here's exactly what we do with your information - in plain English.</p>

    <h2>What Information We Collect (And Why)</h2>

    <h3>When You Browse</h3>
    <div class="info-box">
        <strong>What:</strong> Pages you visit, paintings you look at<br>
        <strong>Why:</strong> To show you more of what you like<br>
        <strong>Stored:</strong> Anonymous data only - we don't know it's "you"
    </div>

    <h3>When You Buy</h3>
    <div class="info-box">
        <strong>What:</strong> Name, email, shipping address, payment info<br>
        <strong>Why:</strong> To deliver your painting and send you updates<br>
        <strong>Payment:</strong> We use secure payment processors (Stripe/PayPal). We never see or store your full card details - only they do.
    </div>

    <h3>When You Create an Account (Optional)</h3>
    <div class="info-box">
        <strong>What:</strong> Email and password<br>
        <strong>Why:</strong> So you can track orders and save favorites<br>
        <strong>Your Choice:</strong> You don't need an account to buy
    </div>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>What We DON'T Do</h2>
    <ul class="dont-list">
        <li><strong>We don't sell your data.</strong> Ever. To anyone.</li>
        <li><strong>We don't spam you.</strong> You'll only get order updates and (if you choose) occasional emails about new paintings.</li>
        <li><strong>We don't track you across the internet.</strong> What you do on other websites is your business.</li>
        <li><strong>We don't share your info with advertisers.</strong> We're not interested in that business model.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What We DO With Your Information</h2>
    <ul class="do-list">
        <li><strong>Ship your painting</strong> - We need your address for that!</li>
        <li><strong>Send order updates</strong> - "Your painting has shipped!" type emails</li>
        <li><strong>Provide customer support</strong> - If you have questions or issues</li>
        <li><strong>Improve our website</strong> - Understanding what paintings people love helps us grow</li>
        <li><strong>Legal requirements only</strong> - If required by law (very rare for a small art business)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>Your Choices & Rights</h2>
    <h3>You Control Your Data</h3>

        <p><strong>Want us to delete everything?</strong> Just ask - we'll erase all your personal data (except order history required by tax law for 7 years).</p>

    <h2>Cookies (The Digital Kind)</h2>
    <p>We use a few cookies to make the website work:</p>

    <ul class="cookie-list">
        <li><strong>Essential cookies:</strong> Remember your cart items</li>
        <li><strong>Preference cookies:</strong> Remember your language choice</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics cookies:</strong> Help us see which paintings are popular (anonymous data)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>No account needed:</strong> You can decline optional cookies and still buy paintings - your cart will just reset when you close the browser.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>International Shipping & Data</h2>
    <p><strong>We ship to:</strong> UK, Australia, Norway, Denmark, France, Italy, and more European countries.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Your data may be processed in:</strong> India (where we're based) and the country you're in.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Your rights:</strong> You have strong privacy rights under GDPR (Europe), UK Data Protection Act, and other local laws. We respect them all.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our paintings are for adults to buy. We don't knowingly collect information from anyone under 16.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <ul class="security-list">
        <li><strong>Encrypted connections:</strong> Your data travels securely (SSL/TLS encryption)</li>
        <li><strong>Secure servers:</strong> Your information is stored safely</li>
        <li><strong>Limited access:</strong> Only the business owner and essential staff can see customer data</li>
        <li><strong>No data breaches yet:</strong> And we work hard to keep it that way</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>If something goes wrong:</strong> We'll email you immediately and explain what happened and what we're doing about it.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we change anything important, we'll:</p>
    <ol style="margin-left: 20px; color: #555;">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Update the date at the top</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Email all customers with the changes</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Keep the old version available for 90 days</li>
    </ol>
    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Small updates (like fixing typos) won't trigger emails.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <div class="contact-box">
        <h3>Questions? Concerns?</h3>
        <p><strong>This is a small, family-run business.</strong> There's a real person reading your emails.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Complaints:</strong> If you're in Europe/UK and unhappy with how we handle your data, you can also contact your local data protection authority. We'd prefer to resolve it directly with you first!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bottom-line">
        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>We're artists and small business owners, not a big corporation. We collect only what we need to send you beautiful paintings. We don't play games with your data. We treat your information the way we'd want ours treated.</p>
        <p><strong>That's it. Really.</strong></p>
