        <p><strong>Why:</strong> To show you more of what you like</p>
        <p><strong>Stored:</strong> Anonymous data only - we don't know it's "you"</p>
      </div>

      <h3>When You Buy</h3>
      <div class="info-box">
        <p><strong>What:</strong> Name, email, shipping address, payment info</p>
        <p><strong>Why:</strong> To deliver your painting and send you updates</p>

        <li><strong>We don't spam you.</strong> You'll only get order updates and (if you choose) occasional emails about new paintings.</li>
        <li><strong>We don't track you across the internet.</strong> What you do on other websites is your business.</li>
        <li><strong>We don't share your info with advertisers.</strong> We're not interested in that business model.</li>

      <h2>Questions? Concerns?</h2>

    <section class="terms-section highlight-box">
      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
      <p>We're artists and small business owners, not a big corporation. We collect only what we need to send you beautiful paintings. We don't play games with your data. We treat your information the way we'd want ours treated.</p>
      <p><strong>That's it. Really.</strong></p>
